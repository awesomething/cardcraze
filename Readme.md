# Card Craze

## Description
This is the craziest card game you ever played with multi-player users in real-time

### General Requirements
- This is a solo project!
- Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together
- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
- This game must run in a web browser
- This game must be tracked in GitHub, with a minimum on 10 commits
- Ideally, put your empty project up on GitHub on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day
- This game must be deployed on GitHub Pages or another location


### Game Requirements
- This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
- The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
- For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
- The HTML code should use sematic tags
